# Project_1_Adjective

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?


I expect to see weekly pushes to your Github repo with notable progress development each week. Code must be 150 lines or more, not including spacing, comments or commented out code.
