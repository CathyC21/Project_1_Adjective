# Project_1_Adjective

Think of how you could exemplify an adjective. How could you visually describe it? 

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement? How can you manipulate time, to create changes and other choregraphies? I want to see you push yourselves and to experiment. Remember, work for your portfolio. You want to have something that you can show off to someone, a potential employers or collaborator. Don't just work to complete the assignment.


I expect to see weekly pushes to your Github repo with notable progress development each week. Code must be 150 lines or more, not including curly bracket lines, spacing, comments or commented out code.
